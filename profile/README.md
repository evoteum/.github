## 🔹 About Us  
At **evoteum**, we believe in **practical innovation**. We like to solve real-world problems.

We believe in [freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software), so we publish everything that we do under free
licences and use free tools wherever we can. For example,

| Instead of... | ...we use     |
|---------------|---------------|
| Dockerfile    | Containerfile |
| Dockerhub     | Quay.io       |
| Terraform     | OpenTofu      |


## Getting started
🔹 **[estate-repos](https://github.com/evoteum/estate-repos)** configures all our repositories using
[repos.yml](https://github.com/evoteum/estate-repos/blob/main/repos.yml). Key automations include;

- **Repository Management**: Automates creation, configuration, and updates for GitHub repositories, including standardised documentation and variable handling.
- **Base Infrastructure Management**: Manages required infrastructure such as Quay.io repositories.
- **GitHub Actions Management**: Deploys and updates workflows automatically across repositories, using centralised, reusable configurations.

It is also a good way to see what each repo is
about in a single glance.
